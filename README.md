# Helpful Scripts

## add_kernel

`add_kernel.sh` will add a python kernel linking from given conda environment to jupyterlab using the given display name. Created with heavy inspiration from [neatshell's simple bash template](https://gist.github.com/neatshell/5283811).

Prereqs:

* Conda if on Ubuntu, miniconda3 if on MacOS. 
* Must have python and ipykernel installed in given environment.
* Assumes .conda and /opt/miniconda folders are in home folder (change lines 100-107 as needed).

```bash
# give execute permission
sudo chmod 700 add_kernel.sh

# default os is mac
./add_kernel.sh -e my_env -d "My Env" -os "ubuntu" 
```

`--help` output:

```bash
usage: add_kernel MANDATORY [OPTION]

Adds a python kernel to the jupyterlab instance.

MANDATORY:
  -e, --env           str  Name of conda environment
  -d, --display_name  str  What is shown inside JupyterLab
OPTION:
  -o, --os            str  What os is used. Accepts 'mac' (default) or 'ubuntu' as parameters.
  -h, --help               Prints this help

example: add_kernel -e my_env -d 'My Env'
```

## backup_server

`backup_server.sh` initiates `rsync` command to backup SMB folders in order of importance. All outputs will be shown in the terminal and saved in `output.txt`. Created to backup FreeNAS shares to an external hard drive over the network. Modify:

* Line 3: change name or order of folders
* Line 8: change location of SMB mount and backup location

Sample output:

<img src="https://github.com/pomkos/homeserver/raw/master/backup_sample.png" width="720">

## initiate_ubuntu

`initiate_ubuntu.sh` will be a collection of commands to carry out common tasks whenever a new ubuntu server is created. Right now it:

1. Appends HDA SMB folder locations to fstab file
2. Creates new folders for the defined SMB folders under `/mnt/Network/$folder`
3. Creates `.smbcredentials` file with the passed `-u` and `-p` variables, with `chmod 600`
4. Mounts all folders in the fstab file

Modify:

* Lines 16-25, settings for server location, folder names, etc.
* Lines 132-146, folders that have spaces in them are special cases that need to be added to fstab with `\040` in place of space
* Line 158, if the password protected folder is not outside the $remote_mount folder

## mount_usb

`mount_usb.sh` asks user for drive info and then mounts the USB drive to

1. Prints all connected drives that are named "sd**"
2. Asks user for drive name (ex: sda1)
3. Asks user for file system type (ex: ntfs)
4. Mounts the drive to `/mnt/usb`

Modify: 

1. Lines 47 and 52, location to mount the drive to
